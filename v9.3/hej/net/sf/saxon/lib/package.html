<title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.lib</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package collects together interfaces intended for user applications to implement
    in order to customize Saxon's behavior, default implementations of these interfaces,
    and classes containing constants that are used in public Saxon interfaces.</p>

<p>These interfaces were brought together into this package in Saxon 9.3, having previously
been dispersed around the package hierarchy and mixed with classes and interfaces intended
only for internal use.</p>
