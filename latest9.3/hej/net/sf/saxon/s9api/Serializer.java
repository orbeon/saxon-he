/**
 * A Serializer takes a tree representation of XML and turns it into lexical XML markup.
 *
 * <p><i>Note that this is XML serialization in the sense of the W3C XSLT and XQuery specifications.
 * This has nothing to do with the serialization of Java objects, or the {@link java.io.Serializable}
 * interface.</i></p>
 *
 * <p>The serialization may be influenced by a number of serialization parameters. A parameter has a name,
 * which is an instance of {@link Serializer.Property}, and a value, which is expressed as a string.
 * The effect of most of the properties is as described in the W3C specification
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization/">XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization</a>.
 * Saxon supports all the serialization parameters defined in that specification, together with some
 * additional parameters, whose property names are prefixed "SAXON_".
 *
 * <p>Serialization parameters defined via this interface take precedence over any serialization parameters
 * defined within the source of the query or stylesheet.
