/**
  * Receiver: This interface represents a recipient of XML tree-walking (push) events. It is
  * based on SAX2's ContentHandler, but adapted to handle additional events, and
  * to use Saxon's name pool. Namespaces and Attributes are handled by separate events
  * following the startElement event. Schema types can be defined for elements and attributes.
  * <p>
  * The Receiver interface is an important internal interface within Saxon, and provides a powerful
  * mechanism for integrating Saxon with other applications. It has been designed with extensibility
  * and stability in mind. However, it should be considered as an interface designed primarily for
  * internal use, and not as a completely stable part of the public Saxon API.
