     * appears. The base URI is available only in cases where the collation URI is resolved
     * at compile time; in cases where the collation URI is not resolved until execution
     * time (typically because it is supplied as an expression rather than as a string literal)
     * this parameter is currently set to null.

     * needs it.
     * @return a StringCollator, representing the collation to be used. Note that although
     * any StringCollator may be returned, functions such as contains() that need to break
     * a string into its collation units will work only if the returned StringCollator
     * is a {@link net.sf.saxon.lib.SubstringMatcher}.

     * Note that unlike the JAXP URIResolver, returning null does not cause the default
     * CollationURIResolver to be invoked; if this is required, the user-written CollationURIResolver
     * should explicitly instantiate and invoke the {@link StandardCollationURIResolver} before
     * returning null.</p>
     * @since 8.5/8.9 (this interface was introduced provisionally in 8.5, and modified in 8.9 to return
     * a StringCollator rather than a Comparator).
