/**
 * A Receiver that can be inserted into an event pipeline to copy location information.
 * The class acts as a LocationProvider, so it supports getSystemId() and getLineNumber() methods;
 * the location returned can vary for each node, and is set by the class generating the events.
 * The class is used when it is necessary to copy a subtree along with its location information;
 * for example, when copying an inline schema within a stylesheet to a separate schema document.
 *
 * <p><i>Note: prior to 9.2, the LocationCopier was a ProxyReceiver that passed all events on the
 * pipeline unchanged. It no longer does this, instead it is found as the LocationProvider on a
 * pipeline, but does not itself see the pipeline events.</i></p>
