/**
* An object representing an XPath variable for use in the JAXP XPath API. The object
 * is created at compile time when the parser tries to bind a variable reference; the
 * value is fetched at run-time from the XPathVariableResolver. With this interface,
 * there is no way of reporting a static error if the variable has not been declared.
 * <p>
 * In Saxon terms, this class is both a VariableDeclaration and a Binding. Unlike
 * a normal VariableDeclaration, it isn't created in advance, but is created on demand
 * when the parser encounters a variable reference. This actually means that if the
 * XPath expression contains two references to the same variable, two VariableDeclarations
 * will be created; however, they will be indistinguishable to the VariableResolver.
 * Acting as a VariableDeclaration, the object goes through the motions of fixing up
 * a binding to a variable reference (in practice, of course, there is exactly one
 * reference to the variable). Acting as a run-time binding, it then evaluates the
 * variable by calling the XPathVariableResolver supplied by the API caller. If no
 * XPathVariableResolver was supplied, an error is reported when a variable is encountered;
 * but if the variable resolver doesn't recognize the variable name, it returns null,
 * which is treated as an empty sequence.
 * </p>
