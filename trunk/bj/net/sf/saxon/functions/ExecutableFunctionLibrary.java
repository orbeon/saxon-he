/**
 * An ExecutableFunctionLibrary is a function library that contains definitions of functions for use at
 * run-time. Normally functions are bound at compile-time; however there are various situations in which
 * the information is needed dynamically, for example (a) to support the XSLT function-available() call
 * (in the pathological case where the argument is not known statically), (b) to allow functions to be
 * called from saxon:evaluate(), (c) to allow functions to be called from a debugging breakpoint.
 *
 * The objects actually held in the ExecutableFunctionLibrary are UserFunctionCall objects that have been
 * prepared at compile time. These are function calls that do full dynamic type checking: that is, they
 * are prepared on the basis that the static types of the arguments are all "item()*", meaning that full
 * type checking is needed at run-time.
