/**
 * A SequenceIterator is used to iterate over a sequence. An AtomizableIterator
 * is a SequenceIterator that can be asked to atomize any nodes encountered
 * in this sequence. It does not actually have to perform this atomization, it merely
 * has to accept the request. If atomization is requested, the iterator can atomize
 * some, all, or none of the nodes it encounters at its discretion: any that are
 * not atomized will be handled by the containing Atomizer.
 *
 * This mechanism provides an optimization, allowing atomization to occur at a lower
 * level of the system, which avoids the overheads of node creation in some tree
 * models.

     * values of the nodes rather than the nodes themselves. The implementation
     * is free to ignore this hint.

     * nodes that are returned, and is therefore willing to accept the typed
     * value of the nodes instead of the nodes themselves.
