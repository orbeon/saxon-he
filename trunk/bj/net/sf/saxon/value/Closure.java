/**
 * A Closure represents a value that has not yet been evaluated: the value is represented
 * by an expression, together with saved values of all the context variables that the
 * expression depends on.
 *
 * <p>This Closure is designed for use when the value is only read once. If the value
 * is read more than once, a new iterator over the underlying expression is obtained
 * each time: this may (for example in the case of a filter expression) involve
 * significant re-calculation.</p>
 *
 * <p>The expression may depend on local variables and on the context item; these values
 * are held in the saved XPathContext object that is kept as part of the Closure, and they
 * will always be read from that object. The expression may also depend on global variables;
 * these are unchanging, so they can be read from the Bindery in the normal way. Expressions
 * that depend on other contextual information, for example the values of position(), last(),
 * current(), current-group(), should not be evaluated using this mechanism: they should
 * always be evaluated eagerly. This means that the Closure does not need to keep a copy
 * of these context variables.</p>
