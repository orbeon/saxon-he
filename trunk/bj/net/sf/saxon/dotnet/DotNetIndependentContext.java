 * This is a variant on the IndependentContext used by the free-standing XPath API in the
 * .NET product. It differs from its parent in the way variables are handled. Instead of
 * the Variable object being used both at compile time and at run-time, it is immutable once
 * compiled; run-time values are held instead in the dynamic context stack-frame, allowing
 * compiled XPathExpressions to be executed safely in multiple threads. This change should
 * probably be migrated into the superclass at some stage, but may affect existing interfaces
 * for example for debuggers.
