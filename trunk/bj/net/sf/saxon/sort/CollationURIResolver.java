 */

    /**
     * Resolve a collation URI (expressed as a string) and return
     * the corresponding collation.
     * @param relativeURI the collation URI as written in the query or stylesheet
     * @param baseURI The base URI of the static context where the collation URI
     * appears. The base URI is available only in cases where the collation URI is resolved
     * at compile time; in cases where the collation URI is not resolved until execution
     * time (typically because it is supplied as an expression rather than as a string literal)
     * this parameter is currently set to null.
     * @param config The configuration. Provided in case the collation URI resolver
     * needs it.
     * @return a Comparator, representing the collation to be used. Note that although
     * any Comparator may be returned, functions such as contains() that need to break
     * a string into its collation units will work only if the returned Comparator
     * is a {@link java.text.Collator}. If the Collation URI cannot be resolved, return null.
     * Note that unlike the JAXP URIResolver, returning null does not cause the default
     * CollationURIResolver to be invoked; if this is required, the user-written CollationURIResolver
     * should explicitly instantiate and invoke the {@link StandardCollationURIResolver} before
     * returning null.
     * @since 8.5 (this interface is new in Saxon 8.5 and may be revised in the light of
     * experience)
