/**
 * This abstract class is provided to allow user-written extension functions to be implemented
 * with the full capabilities of functions that are an intrinsic part of the Saxon product.
 * In particular, the class has the opportunity to save data from the static context and
 * to optimize itself at compile time.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are created by calling the method makeCallExpression() on the
 * {@link ExtensionFunctionDefinition} object that represents the definition of the function.</p>
 *
 * <p>The compiler will create one instance of this class for each function call appearing in the
 * expression being compiled. The class must therefore have a public zero-argument constructor.</p>
 *
 * <p>The compiler will ensure that the supplied arguments in the extension function call are converted
 * if necessary to the declared argument types, by applying the standard conversion rules. The result
 * returned by the function is checked against the declared return type, but no conversion takes place:
 * the returned value must strictly conform to the declared type.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that an IntegratedFunction is trusted; calls are allowed even if the configuration option
 * {@link net.sf.saxon.lib.FeatureKeys#ALLOW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS} is false. In cases where an IntegratedFunction
 * is used to load and execute untrusted code, it should check this configuration option before doing so.</p>
