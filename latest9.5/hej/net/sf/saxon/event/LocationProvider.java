 * PipelineConfiguration object; on the input pipeline, this will be a {@link SaxonLocator} object,
 * on the output pipeline, it will be a {@link net.sf.saxon.expr.instruct.LocationMap}

 * A LocationProvider that represents locations in the source document from which the events
 * are derived (as distinct from locations in a query or stylesheet of the instructions causing the
 * events) will also implement the marker interface {@link net.sf.saxon.event.SourceLocationProvider}
