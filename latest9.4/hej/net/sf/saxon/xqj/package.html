  <body>
    <p>This package contains an implementation of the XQJ specification
    defined in JSR 225. This API is not yet part of the Java Standard Edition platform, but it
    is widely supported by a variety of Java-based XQuery engines.</p>
    
    <p>Saxon's implementation of the {@link javax.xml.xquery.XQDataSource} class is
        {@link net.sf.saxon.xqj.SaxonXQDataSource}. Generally, this is the only class
    that applications need to access directly (all other access can be done by using
    standard XQJ interfaces). However, if there is a need to mix XQuery access with other
    Saxon functionality such as schema processing, then it is often useful to cast the
    XQJ objects to their underlying Saxon implementation classes, which make additional
    methods available.</p>

   <p>In general it is not possible to mix Saxon implementation classes of the XQJ interface
   with implementation classes from other vendors. That is, if an interface specifies that
   a value of an XQJ type must be passed as an argument, Saxon in general requires the value
   to belong to a Saxon implementation of that interface.</p>
