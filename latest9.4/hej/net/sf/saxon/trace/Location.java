package net.sf.saxon.trace;

/**
 * This class holds constants identifying different kinds of location in a source stylesheet or query.
 * These constants are used in the getConstructType() method of class InstructionInfo. Some of these
 * locations represent points where the dynamic context changes, and they are therefore recorded as
 * such on the context stack. Some of the locations represent points in the evaluation of a stylesheet
 * (or query or XPath expression) that are notified to the trace listener. Some fulfil both roles.
 *
 * <p>Any constant used in {@link net.sf.saxon.om.StandardNames} can be used as a Location. Such
 * names are generally used to identify XSLT instructions. They are also used for equivalent constructs
 * in XQuery, for example XSL_ELEMENT is used for a computed element constructor in XQuery. The constants
 * in StandardNames are all in the range 0-1023, so constants defined in this class are outside this
 * range.</p>
 *
 * <p>The constants in this file are annotated with Q to indicate they can appear in XQuery trace output,
 * T to indicate they can appear in XSLT trace output, and/or C to indicate that they can appear on the
 * dynamic context stack.</p>
