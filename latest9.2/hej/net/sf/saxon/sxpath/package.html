<title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.sxpath</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides an alternative API for executing XPath expressions
directly from a Java application: unlike the API in package <code>net.sf.saxon.xpath</code>, these
interfaces are not dependent on JAXP 1.3. The API can be used either in a free-standing
Java application (that is, where there is no XSLT stylesheet), or it can be
used from within Java extension functions called from XPath expressions within
a stylesheet.</p>

<p>The preferred API for executing XPath expressions in Saxon is the <code>s9api</code>
package. This package is older, and provides a lower-level interface that offers access to more
internal details, but is not so convenient to use.</p>
