    <title>Package overview: net.sf.saxon.jaxp</title>

</head>
<body>
<p>This experimental package contains classes that implement C# APIs on top of the Saxon/C product.
This is part of an investigation to explore whether it would be possible eventually to replace
the IKVM-based Saxon/.NET product with an implementation based on the Excelsior JET technology.</p>

<p>These classes are not yet part of any released product.</p>
