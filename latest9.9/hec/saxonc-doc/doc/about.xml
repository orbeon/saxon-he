   <h1>About Saxon/C</h1>

   <p>Saxon/C is a cross-compiled variant of Saxon from the Java platform to the C/C++
               platform, with extensions for PHP and Python.
               All features of Saxon have been ported, other than those (such as collations) that are necessarily platform dependent.
               In particular, Saxon/C provides processing in XSLT, XQuery and XPath, and Schema validation.
               It therefore makes these processing capabilities available to a plethora of other
               languages that are strongly coupled to C/C++ such as PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby.
               (For instance, <a class="bodylink" href="https://github.com/rimmartin/saxon-node"
                   target="_blank">saxon-node</a> uses Saxon/C to create an interface with with node.js.)
