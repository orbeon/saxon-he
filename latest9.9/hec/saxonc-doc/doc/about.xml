   <h1>About Saxon/C</h1>

   <p>Saxon/C is a cross-compiled variant of Saxon from the Java platform to the C/C++ platform,
      with extensions for PHP and Python. All features of Saxon have been ported, other than those
      (such as collations) that are necessarily platform dependent. In particular, Saxon/C provides
      processing in XSLT, XQuery and XPath, and Schema validation. It therefore makes these
      processing capabilities available to a plethora of other languages that are strongly coupled
      to C/C++ such as PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby. (For instance, <a
         href="https://github.com/rimmartin/saxon-node" target="_blank">saxon-node</a> uses Saxon/C
      to create an interface with Node.js.) </p>

   <p>Saxon/C 1.2 is built from the Saxon 9.9.1.5 Java product using Excelsior JET Enterprise 15.3
      edition (MP1). The APIs support the current W3C Recommendations: XSLT 3.0, XQuery 3.1, XPath
      3.1 and Schema Validation 1.0/1.1. See the Saxon 9.9 documentation <a
         href="https://saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!conformance">Standards Conformance</a>
      section for full details.</p>

   <p>Saxon/C is released in three separate editions, as on the Java platform: the commercial
      products Enterprise Edition (Saxon-EE/C) and Professional Edition (Saxon-PE/C), and the
      opensource product Home Edition (Saxon-HE/C). See the <a target="_blank"
         href="https://saxonica.com/products/feature-matrix-9-9.xml">feature matrix</a> to compare
      the features of the HE, PE and EE products.</p>

   <p>Versions are available for the following platforms: Linux 64-bit, Mac OS and Windows 64-bit.
      (Note that from Saxon/C 1.2 versions are no longer available for 32-bit systems.)</p>
