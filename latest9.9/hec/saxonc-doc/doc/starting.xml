   <section id="installing" title="Installing Saxon/C">
      <h1>Installing Saxon/C</h1>
      <p>Saxon/C can be installed on Linux, Mac OS and Windows. In this section we provide a step by
         step installation guide for the three platforms.</p>

      <nav>
         <ul/>
      </nav>

      <p>For information on installing the PHP and Python extensions see the <a
            href="/starting/installingphp">PHP Extension</a> and <a
            href="/starting/installingpython">Python Extension</a> sections.</p>

      <section id="installingLinux" title="Linux">
         <h1>Installing on Linux</h1>

         <aside>In the following, [EDITION] means one of: HE, PE, EE; and [VERSION] is the
            maintenance release version number (for instance 1.2.1). </aside>

         <p>To install the Saxon-[EDITION]/C release, first unzip the file
               <b>libsaxon-[EDITION]C-setupv[VERSION].zip</b> and execute the command:</p>
         <kbd>./libsaxon-[EDITION]C-setup-v[VERSION]</kbd>

         <p>The first step is to select the destination where the product files will be installed.
            The product files are unpacked in the directory 'Saxon-[EDITION]C'.</p>

         <p>Link the dynamic saxon library so it can be found. For example:</p>

         <kbd>ln -s /usr/lib/Saxonica/Saxon-[EDITION]C[VERSION]/libsaxon[EDITION].so
            /usr/lib/libsaxon[EDITION].so</kbd>

         <p>You need to set up the environment for the JET JVM. The JVM is in the directory
            'Saxonica/Saxon-[EDITION]C[VERSION]/rt'. Link the JetVM library so it can be found. For
            example:</p>

         <kbd>ln -s /usr/lib/Saxonica/Saxon-[EDITION]C[VERSION]/rt /usr/lib/rt</kbd>

         <p>Alternatively you can set the JET-home environment accordly, e.g.
            'JET-home=Saxonica/Saxon-[EDITION]C[VERSION]/rt'. The directory 'JET-home/lib/amd64'
            must be listed in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. For instance, if you are
            using a bash or Bourne shell, use the following command:</p>

         <kbd style="word-wrap: break-word;">export
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/rt/lib/amd64:/usr/lib/rt/lib/amd64/jetvm:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd>
         <p>So, for Ubuntu, you can create '/etc/ld.so.conf.d/jetvm.conf', with content:</p>
         <samp><![CDATA[# JetVM env path (required for Saxon)
      /usr/lib/rt/lib/amd64
      /usr/lib/rt/lib/amd64/jetvm]]></samp>

         <p>Next run: </p>
         <kbd>sudo ldconfig</kbd>

         <p>The C++ compiler requires the include path to the Java header files during compilation.
            In most cases this is achieved simply by installing gcj-jdk. Alternatively, according to
            http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_23.html, add the Java header file
            dirs in the JAVA_HOME directory to this environment variable used by the compiler. For
            example:</p>

         <kbd style="word-wrap: break-word;"
            >CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/rt/amd64:$JAVA_HOME/include/linux:$JAVA_HOME/include <br/>
            export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</kbd>

         <p>For a 64-bit machine the 'rt' directory and the libsaxon.so library must be copied to
            the location '/usr/lib'. You must also copy the saxon-data directory to a respective
            location based on the machine.</p>

         <p>Saxon/C is now installed, and ready to run. Please see <a href="../running">Running
               Saxon/C</a> to get started. Note that the commercial products Saxon-PE/C and
            Saxon-EE/C require a license, so you may also need to refer to <a href="../licensing"
               >Licensing</a> for details about how to get this set up.</p>

      </section>


      <section id="installingMac" title="Mac OS">
         <h1>Installing on Mac OS</h1>

         <aside>In the following, [EDITION] means one of: HE, PE, EE; and [VERSION] is the
            maintenance release version number (for instance 1.2.1). </aside>

         <p>To install any of the Saxon/C releases on the Mac OS system, first unzip the
            self-contained file <b>libsaxon-[EDITION]-mac-setup-v[VERSION].zip</b>.</p>

         <p>The first step is to copy the library libsaxon[EDITION].dylib and the 'rt' directories
            to your install location. The C/C++ interface by default assumes the library files and
            directories are installed in the directory '/usr/local/lib'. The location of the Saxon/C
            library can be set using the SAXONC_HOME environment variable. The privileges of the
            folders and files may need adjusting after copying everything if you encounter
            permission issues. Use for instance the following commands:</p>

         <kbd>cd libsaxon-HEC-mac-setup-v[VERSION]/</kbd>
         <kbd>sudo cp libsaxonhec.dylib /usr/local/lib/.</kbd>
         <kbd>sudo cp -r rt /usr/local/lib/.</kbd>

         <p>The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must be set as follows:</p>

         <kbd>export JET_HOME=/usr/local/lib/rt</kbd>
         <kbd>export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JET_HOME/lib/jetvm:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd>

         <p>Saxon/C is now installed, and ready to run. Please see <a href="../running">Running
               Saxon/C</a> to get started. Note that the commercial products Saxon-PE/C and
            Saxon-EE/C require a license, so you may also need to refer to <a href="../licensing"

         <aside>In the following, [EDITION] means one of: HE, PE, EE; and [VERSION] is the
            maintenance release version number (for instance 1.2.1). </aside>

         <p>To install the Saxon-[EDITION]/C release, first run the executable
               <b>libsaxon-[EDITION]-win-setup.exe</b>. </p>

         <p>The first step is to select the destination where the product files will be installed -
            the default and recommended location is 'C:\Program
            Files\Saxonica\Saxon[EDITION][VERSION]'. This is the location that the PHP extension
            looks for the Saxon/C DLL library, so we advise using this default location. </p>

   <section id="running" title="Running Saxon/C">
      <h1>Running Saxon/C</h1>

      <p>To check that Saxon/C is correctly installed (having followed the revelant instructions
         from <a href="../installing">Installing Saxon/C</a>, including getting the Saxon license
         location set up as required for Saxon-PE/C or Saxon-EE/C, as described in <a
            href="../licensing">Licensing</a>), you can try running some of the provided samples. </p>

      <p>For example, to run the C++ testXPath sample file on Linux or Mac OS use the following
         commands (where [PLATFORM] is linux or mac):</p>

      <kbd>cd samples/cppTests/</kbd>
      <kbd>./build64-[PLATFORM].sh</kbd>
      <kbd>./testXPath</kbd>

      <p>Similarly for Windows, use the commands:</p>

      <kbd>cd samples/cppTests/</kbd>
      <kbd>buildCPPSaxon[EDITION].bat</kbd>
      <kbd>testXPath.exe</kbd>

      <p>The 'samples/cppTest' directory provides many more examples in C/C++ which can be run. For
         more information about these samples see <a href="/samples/samples_c">Samples</a>.</p>


      <h2 class="subtitle">Using Saxon/C in applications</h2>

      <p>To get started please browse the <a href="/api">Saxon/C APIs</a>.
            <code>SaxonProcessor</code>, which acts as a factory class for generating the
         processors, is a good place to start.</p>

      <p>The 'samples/cppTest' directory in the download provides example code in C/C++ (and PHP and
         Python) which may also be helpful in learning how to use Saxon/C in your application. For
         further details see <a href="/samples/samples_c">Samples</a>.</p>
      
      <p>There are many parameters and options that can be set to control the way in which Saxon
         behaves. For more information about setting configuration features on
         <code>SaxonProcessor</code> and the other processors in Saxon/C, see <a
            href="/configuration">Configuration</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Commandline Interface</h2>

      <p>Saxon/C can be run from the commandline in a similar way to its Java counterpart. See the
         files Transform.c and Query.c (and for Saxon-EE/C, Validate.c) in the directory 'command'.
         The build.sh script can be executed to build the commandline programs.</p>

      <p>To run Saxon/C from the commandline, the commands look like the following:</p>

      <kbd>./transform [options] [params]</kbd>
      <kbd>./query [options] [params]</kbd>
      <kbd>./validate [options] source.xml</kbd>

      <p>The same commandline options as in the Java products are available in the Saxon/C
         commandline tool. Please see the relevant sections of the Saxon 9.9 documentation for
         details:</p>

   <section id="installingphp" title="PHP Extension">
      <h1>PHP Extension</h1>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Prerequisites</h2>

      <p>Please have the following packages on your machine to build Saxon/C for the PHP language:
         make, php-devel, (php7.2-dev), apache2 or httpd, gcc-c++ or g++, gcj-jdk (or just link the
         jni.h file in the Saxon.C.API directory).</p>

      <p>Saxon/C should already have been installed following the instructions at <a
            href="../installing">Installing Saxon/C</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Installing on Linux and Mac OS</h2>

      <!--<p>(Alternatively, you may like to use the installation script <a 
         href="https://saxonica.com/saxon-c/download/install.sh">install.sh</a> supplied by
         Petr Zak - written for a 64-bit machine, but can be changed for a 32-bit machine.)</p>-->
      <h3>Building with PHP7</h3>
      <p>The PHP interface is in the form of a C/C++ PHP7 extension to Saxon/C created using the
         Zend module API.</p>
      <p>To install, run the following commands:</p>
      <kbd>cd /usr/lib/Saxonica/Saxon-[EDITION]C[VERSION]/Saxon-C-API/</kbd>
      <kbd>phpize</kbd>
      <kbd>./configure --enable-saxon</kbd>
      <kbd>make</kbd>
      <kbd>sudo make install</kbd>

      <h3>Building with PHP5</h3>
      <p>The Saxon/C PHP extension is built for PHP7. To instead build with PHP5, first replace the
         file config.m4 in the directory 'Saxon-C-API/' with the one held in
         'Saxon-C-API/PHP5-Build'. Then run the installation steps above.</p>
      <p>Next create a module conf file: </p>
      <kbd>nano /etc/php/7.2/mods-available/20-saxon.ini</kbd>
      <p>with content:</p>
      <samp><![CDATA[; configuration for php Saxon HE/PE/EE module
         extension=saxon.so]]></samp>
      <p>and save the file. Now enable the module for PHP using the command:</p>
      <kbd>phpenmod saxon</kbd>

      <p>Alternatively, you can update the php.ini file or add the 20-saxon.ini file under the
         'conf.d' directory (if using Ubuntu it is usually in the location '/etc/php/7.2/apache2/')
         to contain the PHP extension. Insert the code <code>extension=saxon.so</code> in the
         Dynamic Extensions section, then run the following commands:</p>

      <kbd>sudo service apache2 restart</kbd>
      <kbd>php -m | grep saxon -i</kbd>

      <p>(Running these should display 'Saxon/C'.)</p>

      <p>If you cannot load the extension from the php.ini file, you need to load it at script
         execution time using the code: <code>dl(“saxon.so”);</code>. However this is not
         recommended as the loading and unloading can be slow.</p>

      <p>When working with PHP, the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and SAXONC_HOME should be
         added to the apache environment variables. The apache2 config file is located in one of the
         following locations depending on your linux distribution: </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Ubuntu server: /etc/apache2/envvars</li>
         <li>Centos server: /etc/sysconfig/httpd</li>
         <li>SUSE server: /etc/sysconfig/apache2</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Installing on Windows</h2>

      <p>The PHP extension has not yet been built. It can be built using the PHP source. We hope to
         provide builds for PHP on Windows soon.</p>

      <p>On Windows we recommend setting the cwd using the overloaded constructor because there
         remains an issue with building Saxon/C with PHP when using the function VCWD_GETCWD. That
         is,</p>

      <samp><![CDATA[$proc = new SaxonProcessor('C://www/html//trax//');]]></samp>

      <p>should replace instances of</p>

      <samp><![CDATA[$proc = new SaxonProcessor();]]></samp>

      <p>in your PHP scripts (see the <a href="/samples/samples_php">PHP Samples</a> for an
         example). </p>
   </section>

   <section id="installingpython" title="Python Extension">
      <h1>Python Extension</h1>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Prerequisites</h2>

      <p>Please have the following packages on your machine to build Saxon/C for the Python
         language: Python3 and Cython.</p>

      <p>The Saxon/C Python extension API has been developed using Cython for Python3. Cython is
         required to build the extension library. To install Python and Cython on Mac OS, we
         recommend using brew or MacPorts.</p>

      <p>Saxon/C should already have been installed following the instructions at <a
            href="../installing">Installing Saxon/C</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Installing</h2>

      <p>The Python extension is held in the directory 'Saxon.C.API/python-saxon'. The Python
         extension on the Linux and Mac OS platforms can be built using the following command (with
         a similar command on Windows): </p>

      <kbd>python3 saxon-setup.py build_ext -if</kbd>

   </section>

   <section id="licensing" title="Licensing">
      <h1>Licensing</h1>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Saxon-PE/C and Saxon-EE/C</h2>

      <p>Saxon-PE/C and Saxon-EE/C are commercial products, and require a license key. By
         downloading the software, you agree to the terms and conditions published at <a
            target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/license/eval-license.pdf"
            >https://saxonica.com/license/eval-license.pdf</a> (for use with a free <a
            target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/download/download.xml">evaluation
         license</a>) or <a target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/license/paid-license.pdf"
            >https://saxonica.com/license/paid-license.pdf</a> (in the case of paid-up licenses,
         purchased from our <a target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/shop/shop.html">online
            store</a>).</p>

      <h3>Location of the Saxon license file</h3>

      <p>Saxon/C looks in the path relative to where the main library has been installed. For
         example, in '/usr/lib' if this is where libsaxon[EDITION]c.so has been installed.
         Alternatively, Saxon also looks for the license according to the environment variable
         SAXONC_HOME, if this has been set. The license file can also be placed in the same
         directory as the stylesheet, but we advise against this for PHP servers where the license
         might be compromised. </p>

      <p>Alternatively a user can use the <code>licenseFileLocation</code> configuration property to
         provide the license location (see the Saxon 9.9 documentation for details of this and other
            <a href="https://saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!configuration/config-features"
            target="_blank">configuration features</a>). For example, to provide the
            <code>licenseFileLocation</code> in PHP:</p>
      <samp><![CDATA[$saxonProc = new Saxon\SaxonProcessor(true);
$saxonProc->setConfigurationProperty("http://saxon.sf.net/feature/licenseFileLocation", "/usr/lib/saxon-license.lic");]]></samp>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Saxon-HE/C</h2>

      <p>Saxon-HE/C is an open-source product. The primary license is the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License version 2.0</a>. In most
         cases, the source files are marked as being "incompatible with secondary licenses", which
         means that the code cannot be combined with code issued under a GPL license (the reason for
         this is the difficulty of contacting all past contributors to gain their assent).</p>
      <p>Some components are licensed under the Apache version 2.0 license or under BSD-style
         licenses. For more information see the <a href="https://saxonica.com/license/license.xml"
