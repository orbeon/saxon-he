      <h1>Licensing</h1>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Saxon-PE/C and Saxon-EE/C</h2>

      <p>Saxon-PE/C and Saxon-EE/C are commercial products, and require a license key. By
         downloading the software, you agree to the terms and conditions published at <a
            target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/license/eval-license.pdf"
            >https://saxonica.com/license/eval-license.pdf</a> (for use with a free <a
            target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/download/download.xml">evaluation
         license</a>) or <a target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/license/paid-license.pdf"
            >https://saxonica.com/license/paid-license.pdf</a> (in the case of paid-up licenses,
         purchased from our <a target="_blank" href="https://saxonica.com/shop/shop.html">online
            store</a>).</p>

      <h3>Location of the Saxon license file</h3>

      <p>Saxon/C looks in the path relative to where the main library has been installed. For
         example, in <code>/usr/lib</code> if this is where <code>libsaxon[EDITION]c.so</code> has
         been installed. Alternatively, Saxon also looks for the license according to the
         environment variable <code>SAXONC_HOME</code>, if this has been set.</p>
      <!--<p>The license file can also be placed in the same directory as the stylesheet, but we advise
         against this for PHP servers where the license might be compromised.</p>-->

      <p>Alternatively the <code>licenseFileLocation</code> configuration property can be used to
         provide the license location (see <a href="/configuration">Configuration</a> for more
         details about setting configuration features). For example, to provide the
            <code>licenseFileLocation</code> in PHP:</p>
      <samp><![CDATA[$saxonProc = new Saxon\SaxonProcessor(true);
$saxonProc->setConfigurationProperty("http://saxon.sf.net/feature/licenseFileLocation", "/usr/lib/saxon-license.lic");]]></samp>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Saxon-HE/C</h2>

      <p>Saxon-HE/C is an open-source product. The primary license is the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License version 2.0</a>. In most
         cases, the source files are marked as being "incompatible with secondary licenses", which
         means that the code cannot be combined with code issued under a GPL license (the reason for
         this is the difficulty of contacting all past contributors to gain their assent).</p>

      <p>Some components are licensed under the Apache version 2.0 license or under BSD-style
         licenses. For more information see the <a href="https://saxonica.com/license/license.xml"
            target="_blank">Licenses</a> section on the main Saxonica website.</p>

      <p>Although Saxon/C technically adheres to the definition of open source software, there are
         practical limitations. Specifically, the "Source Code Form" of the product, in the
         terminology of the MPL license, consists primarily of Java source code, and in order to
         build Saxon/C from the Java source code, you need access to the Excelsor JET development
         tools, which are no longer commercially available to new users.</p>


   </section>

   <section id="running" title="Running Saxon/C">
      <h1>Running Saxon/C</h1>

      <p>To check that Saxon/C is correctly installed (having followed the revelant instructions
         from <a href="../installing">Installing Saxon/C</a>, including getting the Saxon license
         location set up as required for Saxon-PE/C or Saxon-EE/C, as described in <a
            href="../licensing">Licensing</a>), you can try running some of the provided samples. </p>

      <p>For example, to run the C++ <code>testXPath</code> sample file on Linux or Mac OS use the
         following commands (where [PLATFORM] is linux or mac):</p>

      <kbd>cd samples/cppTests/</kbd>
      <kbd>./build64-[PLATFORM].sh</kbd>
      <kbd>./testXPath</kbd>

      <p>Similarly for Windows, use the commands:</p>

      <kbd>cd samples/cppTests/</kbd>
      <kbd>buildCPPSaxon[EDITION].bat</kbd>
      <kbd>testXPath.exe</kbd>

      <p>The <code>samples/cppTest</code> directory provides many more examples in C/C++ which can
         be run. For more information about these samples see <a href="/samples/samples_c"
            >Samples</a>.</p>


      <h2 class="subtitle">Using Saxon/C in applications</h2>

      <p>To get started please browse the <a href="/api">Saxon/C APIs</a>.
            <code>SaxonProcessor</code>, which acts as a factory class for generating the
         processors, is a good place to start.</p>

      <p>The <code>samples/cppTest</code> directory in the download provides example code in C/C++
         (and PHP and Python) which may also be helpful in learning how to use Saxon/C in your
         application. For further details see <a href="/samples/samples_c">Samples</a>.</p>

      <p>There are many parameters and options that can be set to control the way in which Saxon
         behaves. For more information about setting configuration features on
            <code>SaxonProcessor</code> and the other processors in Saxon/C, see <a
            href="/configuration">Configuration</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Command Line Interface</h2>

      <p>Saxon/C can be run from the command line in a similar way to its Java counterpart. See the
            <code>Transform.c</code> and <code>Query.c</code> files (and <code>Validate.c</code> for
         Saxon-EE/C) in the <code>command</code> directory. The <code>build.sh</code> script can be
         executed to build the command line programs.</p>

      <p>To run Saxon/C from the command line, the commands look like the following:</p>

      <kbd>./transform [options] [params]</kbd>
      <kbd>./query [options] [params]</kbd>
      <kbd>./validate [options] source.xml</kbd>

      <p>The same command line options as in the Java products are available in the Saxon/C command
         line tool. Please see the relevant sections of the Saxon 9.9 documentation for details:</p>

   <section id="installingphp" title="PHP Extension">
      <h1>PHP Extension</h1>

      <p>The PHP extension is an interface module that allows Saxon/C to be invoked from PHP
         applications.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Prerequisites</h2>

      <p>Please have the following packages on your machine to build Saxon/C for the PHP language:
            <code>make</code>, <code>php-devel</code>, (<code>php7.2-dev</code>),
            <code>apache2</code> or <code>httpd</code>, <code>gcc-c++</code> or <code>g++</code>,
            <code>gcj-jdk</code> (or just link the <code>jni.h</code> file in the
            <code>Saxon.C.API</code> directory).</p>

      <p>Saxon/C should already have been installed following the instructions at <a
            href="../installing">Installing Saxon/C</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Installing on Linux and Mac OS</h2>

      <!--<p>(Alternatively, you may like to use the installation script <a 
         href="https://saxonica.com/saxon-c/download/install.sh">install.sh</a> supplied by
         Petr Zak - written for a 64-bit machine, but can be changed for a 32-bit machine.)</p>-->

      <h3>Building with PHP7</h3>

      <p>The PHP extension is in the form of a C/C++ PHP7 extension to Saxon/C created using the
         Zend module API.</p>

      <p>To install, run the following commands:</p>

      <kbd>cd /usr/lib/Saxonica/Saxon-[EDITION]C[VERSION]/Saxon-C-API/</kbd>
      <kbd>phpize</kbd>
      <kbd>./configure --enable-saxon</kbd>
      <kbd>make</kbd>
      <kbd>sudo make install</kbd>

      <h3>Building with PHP5</h3>

      <p>The Saxon/C PHP extension is built for PHP7. To instead build with PHP5, first replace the
            <code>config.m4</code> file in the <code>Saxon-C-API/</code> directory with the one held
         in <code>Saxon-C-API/PHP5-Build</code>. Then run the installation steps above.</p>

      <p>Next create a module conf file: </p>

      <kbd>nano /etc/php/7.2/mods-available/20-saxon.ini</kbd>

      <p>with content:</p>

      <samp><![CDATA[; configuration for php Saxon HE/PE/EE module
         extension=saxon.so]]></samp>

      <p>and save the file. Now enable the module for PHP using the command:</p>

      <kbd>phpenmod saxon</kbd>

      <p>Alternatively, you can update the <code>php.ini</code> file or add the
            <code>20-saxon.ini</code> file under the <code>conf.d</code> directory (if using Ubuntu
         it is usually in the location <code>/etc/php/7.2/apache2/</code>) to contain the PHP
         extension. Insert the code <code>extension=saxon.so</code> in the Dynamic Extensions
         section, then run the following commands:</p>

      <kbd>sudo service apache2 restart</kbd>
      <kbd>php -m | grep saxon -i</kbd>

      <p>(Running these should display 'Saxon/C'.)</p>

      <p>If you cannot load the extension from the <code>php.ini</code> file, you need to load it at
         script execution time using the code: <code>dl(“saxon.so”);</code>. However this is not
         recommended as the loading and unloading can be slow.</p>

      <p>When working with PHP, the environment variables <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and
            <code>SAXONC_HOME</code> should be added to the apache environment variables. The
         apache2 config file is located in one of the following locations depending on your linux
         distribution: </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Ubuntu server: <code>/etc/apache2/envvars</code></li>
         <li>Centos server: <code>/etc/sysconfig/httpd</code></li>
         <li>SUSE server: <code>/etc/sysconfig/apache2</code></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Installing on Windows</h2>

      <p>The PHP extension has not yet been built. It can be built using the PHP source. We hope to
         provide builds for PHP on Windows soon.</p>

      <p>On Windows we recommend setting the current working directory using the single-argument
         version of the <code>SaxonProcessor</code> constructor, because there remains an issue with
         building Saxon/C with PHP when using the function<code> VCWD_GETCWD</code>. That is,</p>

      <samp><![CDATA[$proc = new SaxonProcessor('C://www/html//trax//');]]></samp>

      <p>should replace instances of</p>

      <samp><![CDATA[$proc = new SaxonProcessor();]]></samp>

      <p>in your PHP scripts (see the <a href="/samples/samples_php">PHP Samples</a> for an
         example). </p>

   <section id="installingpython" title="Python Extension">
      <h1>Python Extension</h1>

      <p>The Python extension is an interface module that allows Saxon/C to be invoked from Python
         applications.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Prerequisites</h2>

      <p>Please have the following packages on your machine to build Saxon/C for the Python
         language: <code>Python3</code> (64-bit) and <code>Cython</code>.</p>

      <p>The Saxon/C Python extension API has been developed using Cython for Python3. Cython is
         required to build the extension library. To install Python and Cython on Mac OS, we
         recommend using brew or MacPorts.</p>

      <p>Saxon/C should already have been installed following the instructions at <a
            href="../installing">Installing Saxon/C</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Installing</h2>

      <p>The Python extension is held in the directory <code>Saxon.C.API/python-saxon</code>. </p>

      <h3>Linux and Mac OS Platforms</h3>
      <p>The Python extension on the Linux and Mac OS platforms can be built using the following
         command:</p>

      <kbd>python3 saxon-setup.py build_ext -if</kbd>

      <h3>Windows Platform</h3>

      <p>The Python extension on the Windows platform can be built using the following instructions:</p>
       <p>Install Python 3.X (64-bit) with VS 2017 or 2019 which can then be run
          with command "py" from Powershell.</p>


      <ul><li>For Python: update pip</li>
         <li>Use pip to install Cython: pip install Cython</li>
       <li>open Powershell for Python 3.X (with administrator rights if you
          installed in C:\Program Files)</li>
      </ul>
      <kbd>cd C:\Program Files\Saxonica\SaxonEDITIONX.X.X</kbd>
      <kbd>cd Saxon.C.API\python-saxon</kbd>
      <kbd>py saxon-setup.py build_ext -if</kbd>
       <p>For arbitrary Powershell Windows need to set: $Env:PYTHONPATH +=
       ";C:\Program Files\Saxonica\SaxonEDITIONX.X.X\Saxon.C.API\python-saxon" to
       ensure that "import saxonc" in any Python program finds the saxonc module</p>

   <section id="troubleshooting" title="Troubleshooting">
      <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

      <p>After installing Saxon/C, if you notice anomalies in execution, then the apache log file
         usually has useful information on errors reported and crashes. See below for a description
         of some of the common errors and crashes, and their solutions:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>
               <code>FATAL ERROR: Unable to load /usr/lib64/rt/lib/amd64/libjava.so (libjvm.so
                  cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory) JNI_CreateJavaVM()
                  failed with result-1</code>
            </p>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> Running the following command should resolve the error:</p>
            <kbd>sudo ldconfig</kbd>
            <p>Ignore the message 'file /lib/libsaxon[EDITION].so is truncated'. The library was created using
            Excelsior JET.</p>
            <p>Alternatively create a symlink to the java virtual machine. This is not required to
               install or compile, but it is required for PHP code. The following command should
               resolve the issue on a 64-bit machine:</p>
            <kbd>ln -s $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so /lib64/libjvm.so<br/></kbd>
            <p>Alternatively, it is possible to link the libjvm.so from the 'rt/lib/jetjvm'
               directory.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <code>/usr/lib/Saxon-C-API/SaxonProcessor.h:3:17: fatal error: jni.h: No such file or
                  directory <br/>#include &lt;jni.h&gt; compilation terminated.</code>
            </p>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> Link the <code>jni.h</code> on the machine or simply install
                  <code>gcj-jdk</code> which should resolve this error. </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <code>PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library
                  '/usr/lib/php/modules/saxon.so' - libsaxonhec.so: cannot enable executable stack
                  as shared object requires: Permission denied in Unknown on line 0</code>
            </p>
            <p>This has been observed on centos systems when SELinux is enforced/enabled.</p>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> Run the following command to show the security setting for the library files:</p>
            <kbd>ls -alZ /usr/lib" and 'ls -alZ /usr/lib/php/module/</kbd>
            <p>Then run the following commands or similar to change the security context:</p>
            <kbd>chcon system_u:object_r:lib_t:s0 /usr/lib/libsaxonhec.so</kbd>
            <kbd>chcon system_u:object_r:lib_t:s0 /usr/lib/php/modules/saxon.so</kbd>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Some 64-bit Linux flavors do not run the 32-bit JET libraries by default.</p>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> For instance, <code>ia32-libs</code> must be installed on
               Ubuntu/Debian, e.g. using the following command:<br/>
            </p>
            <kbd>sudo apt-get install ia32-libs</kbd>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><code>Unable to load C:\Program Files\Saxonica\SaxonHEC1.2.1\libsaxonhec.dll Error: : No error</code></p>
            <p>Caused by attempting to run Saxon/C in 32-bit environments, including 32-bit Python
               and PHP builds. Saxon/C can only run with 64-bit builds.</p>
            <p><b>Solution:</b> 
            The machine operating system must be 64-bit, and Python and PHP builds must be 64-bit to run with Saxon/C.</p>
         </li>
      </ol>
