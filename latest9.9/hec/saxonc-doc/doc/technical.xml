   <h1>Technical Information</h1>

   <p>Saxon/C is built by cross compiling the Java code of Saxon 9.9.1.5 using the Excelsior JET
      15.3 Enterprise edition (MP1). This generates platform specific machine code, which we
      interface with C/C++ using the Java Native Interace (JNI).</p>

   <p><b>Embedded systems</b>: It is also possible to build Saxon/C for embedded systems, for
      example on a Linux/ARM System. If such a build is required please contact Saxonica to discuss
      further: <a href="mailto:support@saxonica.com">support@saxonica.com</a>.</p>

   <p>The PHP interface is in the form of a C/C++ PHP extension to Saxon/C created using the Zend
      module API. Supports PHP5 and PHP7.</p>

   <p>The Python interface is in the form of a Cython module interfaced with the C/C++ Saxon/C API.
      Currently supports Python3.</p>

   <p>The XML parser used is the one supplied by the Excelsior JET runtime which is cross compiled
      from the openJDK 8u181. There are currently no links to libxml.</p>



   <h2>Limitations</h2>

   <p>The following limitations apply to the 1.2.1 release:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>No support for the XDM function type in the XDM data model.</li>
      <li>The bytecode generation feature available in Saxon-EE on Java is not available in
         Saxon-EE/C.</li>
      <li>It is currently not possible to create and export to file a precompiled schema component
         model (SCM).</li>
   </ul>
