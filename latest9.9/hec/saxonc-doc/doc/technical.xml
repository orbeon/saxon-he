    <h1>Technical Information</h1>

    <p>Saxon/C is built by cross compiling the Java code of Saxon 9.9.1.5 using the Excelsior Jet 15.3 Enterprise edition (MP1).
        This generates platform specific machine code, which we interface with C/C++ using the Java Native Interace (JNI).</p>
    <p>The PHP interface is in the form of a C/C++ PHP extension to Saxon/C created using the Zend module API. Supporting PHP5 and PHP7.</p>
    <p>The Python interface is in the form of a Cython module interfaced with the C/C++ Saxon/C API. Currently supporting Python3.</p>
    <p>The XML parser used is the one supplied by the Excelsior JET runtime which is cross compiled from the openJDK 8u181.
        There are currently no links to libxml.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
